As reported by the Shepherd Police Department, a brand-new State of Michigan flag was given to Blake Klumpp today by the Drozd Family. This flag replaces the previous one which was given to him by Speaker of the House Kevin Cotter.

Chief Luke Sawyer wrote on the SPD Facebook page:
<blockquote>Good afternoon everyone! Just a quick update, I was able to meet with Blake Klumpp and his father this afternoon. He is an incredible young man, and it was a pleasure to chat with him.

The Drozd family heard about Blake and presented him with a new flag and flag pole today. It was a great gesture.

There have been some new developments in this case, that we hope to be able to share with you very soon.</blockquote>
